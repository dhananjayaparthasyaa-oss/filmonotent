    <h1>REVIEW - THE BADASS OF BOLLYWOOD</h1>

    <p><strong>The Badass of Bollywood</strong> is a Netflix series that marks the directorial debut of Shah Rukh Khan’s
      son, Aryan Khan—and honestly, it looks pretty solid.</p>

    <p>Performance-wise, the show shines the most. Manoj Pahwa and Raghav Juyal completely steal the spotlight with
      their impeccable comic timing. Every time they appear on screen, the energy changes—you get laughter, joy,
      and a mix of emotions that keep you hooked. The lead, Lakshya Lalwani, also delivers well. His chemistry
      with Raghav feels natural, perfectly capturing the “typical Dilli ka Launda” vibe. After a long time, Bobby
      Deol as the antagonist finally gets a role that allows him to show his acting chops, instead of just being
      used to cash in on his <em>Animal</em> villain image. The series features multiple cameos—some land well,
      some don’t—but they add variety.</p>

    <p>Comedy is definitely the highlight here. Most of the jokes land, and even the situational comedy works
      effectively. The sarcastic tone of the show is another strength—it smartly parodies real-life events and
      pokes fun at the inner workings of Bollywood: nepotism, PR gimmicks, fake personas, and more.</p>

    <p>The downside, however, is the VFX—it’s a huge letdown. Wherever CGI is used, it looks plain bad, which is
      surprising considering it was handled by Red Chillies. Also, the frequent use of abusive language feels a bit
      overdone. And honestly, this project might not have been made if Aryan Khan wasn’t SRK’s son—but that’s the
      reality of the industry.</p>

    <p><strong>Overall:</strong> The Badass of Bollywood is fun, sharp, and entertaining. Despite its flaws, it’s a
      refreshing watch that deserves a chance. Definitely give it a try!</p>
